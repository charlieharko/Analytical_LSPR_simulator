Easy and fast calculation of extinction, scattering, absorbance cross-sections of plasmonic nanoparticles together with their
Quantum Yield and also the dielectric function of Au, Ag and Cu with given shape, dimensions, and material.

The fast calculation is due to the analytical nature of the calculations. This work is part of the project of Natalie Fehn based on the

Tutorial review by Renwen Yu, Luis M. Liz-Marzán, and F. Javier García de Abajo (Chemical Society Reviews, 2017).

The original Matlab code was made by Natalie Fehn and the translation into Python was done by Carlos Renero Lecuna
