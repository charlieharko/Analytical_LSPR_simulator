Size and AR random generator following a normal distribution. As input:
    
    Size = size of the nanorod
    S_stdev = Standard deviation of the size of the nanorod
    
    AR= aspect ration of the nanorod
    AR_stdev = Standard deviation of the AR 
    
    scale = number of nanoparticles to be generated (N)
